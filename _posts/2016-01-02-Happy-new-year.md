title: Happy new year!

This is my first try to setup a blog with
[jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and github pages.

I added a license hint to the template and made some minor changes to the
CSS.  It looks very fine but I'm not an expert in ruby.

## The intention of this blog

Since my very first steps in the internet I've got a homepage. I never
thought that i *really* need a homepage, but there were some moments I
wanted to share some thoughts and I build static pages instead.  Nothing
with a layout or somewhat, just a single page with content shared by its
URL.

That satisfied by needs for years. My homepage had a layout but no content.
So I shutdown my homepage and nobody missed it.

From now on I can do both: share *static* pages by referencing the commit-id
of the blog post or add some nice layouts around.
